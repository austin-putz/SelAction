# Progress log

Where we are in [`implementation-sequence.md`](implementation-sequence.md).
**A short summary is added here after every step (or sub-step) is
finished, newest first.** Read the top entry to see where things stand.

## Current position

- **Last finished:** step 1, T0: deleted the dead `selinbreeding.f90`.
- **Next:** step 2, T1: test tooling (`strict.sh`, `coverage.sh`,
  `compare_out.R`, `run_all.sh`).
- **Waiting on others:** answers from Piter Bijma and Jack Dekkers to the
  open modelling questions, and any worked examples
  (`correspondence/2026-10-bijma-dekkers/`).

## Entry template

```markdown
### Step <#>: <name> (done YYYY-MM-DD, commit <hash>)

- **What changed:** files and behaviour, in plain words.
- **Tests:** what was run and the result (e.g. `make test`: 7/7 golden,
  6/6 error cases; strict build clean).
- **Results changed?** No / Yes: which outputs, and why.
- **Findings:** anything surprising, or anything that needs Austin, Jack
  or Piter.
- **Next:** the next step number and name.

## Log

### Step 1: T0, delete the dead `selinbreeding.f90` (done 2026-10-05, commit "Step 1 (T0): remove dead selinbreeding.f90 from fortran/")

- **What changed:** `fortran/selinbreeding.f90` (an unused older copy of
  the inbreeding routine) is deleted and no longer compiled. The live
  inbreeding code in `selroutines.f90` is untouched. `Makefile`, README,
  CLAUDE.md, the technical report (PDF rebuilt), the test-hardening plan
  and `NEWS.md` updated. The original stays in `fortran_orig/`.
- **Tests:** `make test`: 7/7 golden byte-identical, 6/6 error cases.
  Strict debug build: 6/7 identical, `blup1` differs only by the known
  `-0.000`; 6/6 error cases. The build-by-hand command without `make`
  also passes 7/7.
- **Results changed?** No.
- **Findings:** the `blup1` fixture description said it tested the
  inbreeding code in `selinbreeding.f90`; it actually tests the live
  copy in `selroutines.f90`. Description corrected. Nothing for Jack or
  Piter.
- **Next:** step 2, T1: test tooling.

### Groundwork before step 1 (done 2026-10-05)

- **What changed:**
  - **One source tree** (`1df843a`): `fortran_mac/` was renamed
    `fortran/`, and the old, unfixed `fortran_linux/` was removed.
  - **Build with `make`** (`49e01e4`): output goes to `build/`, and
    `make test` runs the tests.
  - **Bad names stop the run** (`5e98c91`): a file or trait name over 8
    characters, with a space, or (for traits) a duplicate now stops with
    `-error-30-` and exit code 2, instead of being silently cut.
  - **Planning:**
    - the two plans were reordered (`f4fe0ef`)
    - this sequence was written (`e4fa6a0`)
    - long trait names will be handled by the R driver's short labels
      (I/O plan revision 12, `adfdf1a`)
- **Tests:** `make test` passes 7/7 golden fixtures byte-identical and
  6/6 error cases. The strict debug build is clean, apart from the known
  `blup1` `-0.000`.
- **Results changed?** No.
- **Findings:**
  - The 8-character name cut could silently overwrite another run's
    output. It is now fixed.
  - Widening trait names in the Fortran would touch about 340 report
    lines, which is why the driver will handle long names instead.
- **Next:** step 1, T0.
